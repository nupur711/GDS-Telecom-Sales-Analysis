**Domain** : Telecom     **Function** : Executive Management

GrowDataSkills is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. 
GrowDataSkills's business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. 
The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights which would enable them to make informed decisions to recover 
their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users. 

**Task** :
1. Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided.
2. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management.
3. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.
